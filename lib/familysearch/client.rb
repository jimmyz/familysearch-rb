# but I'm just following FamilySearch branding (familysearch.org, not family_search.org and FamilySearch not Familysearch).
module FamilySearch
  # FamilySearch::Client is the core of the +familysearch+ gem. It manages the HTTP requests to
  # the FamilySearch Platform. Under the covers, it is implemented using the wonderful Faraday ruby gem.
  #
  # The +familysearch+ gem relies heavily on Faraday::Middleware features to handle such things such as
  # following redirects, parsing JSON, logging HTTP traffic, and raising errors for non 20x or 30x responses.
  #
  # =Usage:
  # TODO: place some examples here.
  #

    # Initializing a FamilySearch::Client object.
    #
    # *Args*    :
    # - +options+: An Hash containing any of the following configuration items.
    #   - +:key+: Your developer key.
    #   - +:environment+: Accepts the following values: :production, :staging, :sandbox.
    #     It defaults to :sandbox.
    #   - +:base_url+: If you would like to override the base url of the production, staging,
    #     or sandbox environments, you can set this to something else like "http://localhost:8080"
    #   - +:access_token+: (optional) Your access token if you already have one.
    #   - +:logger+: (optional) An object that conforms to the Logger interface.
    #     This could be a Rails logger, or another logger object that writes to
    #     STDOUT or to a file.
    # *Returns* :
    # - +FamilySearch::Client+: a client object for making requests

    #
    # Calling this multiple times should be very cheap because of the caching. a FamilySearch::Client object will only
    # ever make an HTTP request for the discovery resource *once* in its lifetime.
    #
    # * *Returns* :

    # Performs an authentication against the /identity/v2/login resource. It uses the
    # {Discovery Resource}[https://familysearch.org/.well-known/app-meta.json] to determine the URL to make the request to
    # in case the URL ever changes. This is only to be used for testing/development.
    #
    # *Note*: You may *NOT* use this method for building web applications. All web applications must use OAuth/OAuth2.
    # Your web application will not be certified if it prompts for user credentials within the application. Also, you may not use
    # your personal credentials to authenticate your system in behalf of a user.
    #
    # *Args*    :
    # - +username+: A FamilySearch username.
    # - +password+: The user's password.
    # - +key+ (optional): Your developer key if it wasn't already set when you initialized the FamilySearch::Client
    # *Returns* :
    # - true
    # *Raises*  :
    # - +FamilySearch::Error::BadCredentials+: If it cannot authenticate

    #

    #
    # ===Usage:

    #   client = FamilySearch::Client.new

    # Please note, only the +get+ method has been implemented on the URLTemplate object. POST, PUT, and DELETE should be pretty easy
    # to add. It just hasn't been a priority yet.
    #
    # *Args*    :
    # - +template_name+: The name of the template. For the "person-template", you can pass "person-template", "person", or :person
    # *Returns* :
    # - FamilySearch::URLTemplate object
    # *Raises*  :
    # - +FamilySearch::Error::URLTemplateNotFound+: if the template is not found.
    #
